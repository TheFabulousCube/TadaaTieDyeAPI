# TadaaTieDyeAPI in .NET Core
New WebAPI project.  This allows using an Angular/Ionic/Mobile/whatever front end.
-----
 I realized pretty quick (Hey, fail fast & fail forward!) that to use .NET Core on IIS (my local for a QA environment), I had 
to install *ASP.NET Core Module* to IIS.  
Since I'm planing to deploy to shared hosting, and an initial deploy throws the same 503 error my local did, I called them up.  Sure enough, even with the new Plex Onyx, there are no plans to support .NET Core.  So, it'll be a while before I get back to this.
